Usage
=====

`logtailor` is a tail program and filter for log files. You can apply it to a copy of a logfile to filter for specific information, or on a log file of a running application to filter the log output in real time. 

After installing `logtailor` it is available as an executable. To get an overview just call:::

    logtailor --help

This will provide a list of all command line arguments with a short description.


Parsing a log file for some pattern
-----------------------------------

We have a copy of a log file and want to check for certain patterns, e.g., ERROR and WARN logs:::

    logtailor --log file.log --trigger=ERROR --trigger=WARN --history

`--trigger` is used to specify patterns to look for. We need to add `--history` to tell `logtailor` that also already existing log entries shall be considered.


Using s configuration file
--------------------------

When working with the same logs and filters for some time, it gets tedious to enter the same command line arguments over and over again. In this case it is more convenient to use a configuration file. Create a file named `.logtailor.ini` in the folder you run the program. In the configuration file you can configure a list of log files you want to use. Assign a name to each log file to reference it later on:::

    [logfiles]
    log1 = ./logs/application/server.log
    log2 = ./logs/webserver/site.log

In a second section the output file and triggers can be configured:::

    [global]
    output = filtered.log

    triggers =
        ERROR
        interesting message
        server started

With such a configuration you can use the short log names instead of the paths to specify a logfile. All triggers in the configuration will be used automatically. More triggers can be added on the command line:::

    logtailor --log log2 --trigger=WARNING
